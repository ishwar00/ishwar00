### Hallo!

I'm Ishwar, and I plan to introduce myself more fully in a few months.  

In the meantime, here are some projects I built out of curiosity to explore their real-world counterparts:  

- **[NandToTetris](https://github.com/ishwar00/NandToTetris):**  
  An attempt to build a modern computer from NAND logic gates. This project includes a CPU, RAM, an assembler, a virtual machine (VM), and a front-end compiler.  

- **[Knot](https://github.com/ishwar00/knot):**  
  A toy JavaScript runtime environment created to understand the Event Loop.  

- **[Ping-Pong](https://github.com/ishwar00/ping-pong):**  
  A simple game resembling ping-pong, developed to explore collision detection in games.  

- **[SuvidhaJS](https://github.com/ishwar00/suvidha.js):**  
  A library for request validation, response handling, and other related functionalities.  

I also write blogs! You can check them out here: [ishwarstuff.vercel.app](https://ishwarstuff.vercel.app)
